## Overview

<img src="Fig_overview_github.png" width="1000">

The Tapenade pipeline is a tool for the analysis of dense 3D tissues acquired with deep imaging microscopy. It is designed to be user-friendly and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data. The pipeline is composed of several steps, each of which can be run independently.

The pipeline is composed of the following methods:

1. **Spectral filtering**: Given a set of calibrated emission spectra, allows the unmixing of the different fluorophores present in the image. 
2. **Registration & fusion**: Allows for spatial fusion of two images (e.g. acquired with a dual-view microscope).
3. **Pre-processing**: Provides many pre-processing functions, like rescaling, masking, correction of optical artifcats, etc.
4. **Segmentation**: Detect and seperate each nuclei in the image. We provide trained weights for StarDist3D, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for nuclei segmentation.
4. **Masked smoothing**: Produces smooth fields of a given dense or sparse quantity, which allows for multiscale analysis.
5. **Spatial correlation analysis**: Computes a spatial correlation map between two continuous fields.
6. **Deformation tensors analysis**: Computes deformation tensors (inertia, true strain, etc.) from segmented objects.

All methods are explained in details in our Jupyter notebooks, which are available in the `notebooks` folder [here](notebooks/).
